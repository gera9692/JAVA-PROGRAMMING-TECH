Java Dates
Java does not have a built-in Date class, but we can import the java.time package to work with the date and time API. The package includes many date and time classes. For example:

Class	Description
LocalDate	Represents a date (year, month, day (yyyy-MM-dd))
LocalTime	Represents a time (hour, minute, second and nanoseconds (HH-mm-ss-ns))
LocalDateTime	Represents both a date and a time (yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss-ns)
DateTimeFormatter	Formatter for displaying and parsing date-time objects
